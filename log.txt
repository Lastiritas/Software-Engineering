  Iteration 2 Changes
	  Work Flow
		This iteration we changed our approach to tasks assignments and 
		distribution. We went from team members chosing which tasks they 
		wanted to work on at the beginning of the iteration and went to a 
		system where when someone was wanting to do work, they grab any 
		unassigned task.

		This iteration we changed from our multi-branch approach to a single
		branch approach. The multiple branch approach proved too inefficient
		for our team and was causing too many problems. Moving to one branch
		caused us some sability problems but made it much easier to see each
		other's work.

  	Focus
		The focus of this iteration moved from adding more functionality to 
		refining GUI iterations and completing core functionality. We added 
		data mining of labels and filtering, the two features needed to make 
		our application pracitical, and refined the GUI.

		With all core functionality in place, the plan for the next 
		iteration is to go over the big user stories for what extra features 
		the customer wants and to add implement them. We hope to add more 
		unique features to set our system apart from existing systems.
