Here is the description of what I need on this file:

Each group will also keep a log, which describes their progress. Log entries 
will be made by individual group members, and contain information about the 
entire project and individual contributions. It will also describe outstanding 
bugs and their fixes. You should keep the log in a text file log.txt alongside 
your code.

Task assignments, estimates, and actual time spent should be detailed in your 
log. Also in the log, include information about team meetings and the rationale 
behind any major design decisions. 
Use the log to detail who worked on each task, and approximately how long 
was spent on each. Also include the developer tasks from your plan (regardless 
of whether you completed them all).

Please provide as much detail as possible since we left it to the last minute
