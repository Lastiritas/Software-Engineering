Here is the description of what I need on this file

Each group will also keep a log, which describes their progress. Log entries 
will be made by individual group members, and contain information about the 
entire project and individual contributions. It will also describe outstanding 
bugs and their fixes. You should keep the log in a text file log.txt alongside 
your code.

Please provide as much detail as possible since we left it to the last minute
